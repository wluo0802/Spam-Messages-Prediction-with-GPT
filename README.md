# Spam Messages Prediction with GPT
## Dataset
The "SMSSpamCollection" dataset is a public collection of SMS messages that have been tagged as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). This dataset is commonly used in text classification and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially for training and evaluating models designed to identify spam messages. The dataset provides a practical example of a binary classification problem, where the goal is to correctly classify messages into one of two categories based on their content.
